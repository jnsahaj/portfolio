Sometimes, the best place to store state is right in the URL. It’s simple, practical, and often overlooked. Let’s explore why it’s worth considering.

## The Problem

Here's what we want to achieve:
Let's say we have a modal (dialog) component that allows the user to perform some important actions. We would like the modal to stay open even after the user reloads the page.

If we were to just use `useState` for the modal `open` state, we would lose this information when the page reloads. Let's see how we can solve this problem.

/>

## Ways to Store State on the Client

Before we look at the solution, let's look at the options we have to store the `open` state for the modal.
The options can generally be categorized as follows:

#### In the Application

Data that belongs in the working memory of the application. Lasts as long as the application is running.

```ts
const App = () => {
    const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
    return <Modal open={open} onClose={() => setOpen(false)} />;
};
```

#### In the Browser

Data that is stored in the browser. Examples include `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.

```ts
const App = () => {
    const [open, setOpen] = useState(() =>
        localStorage.getItem("modalOpen") === "true"
    );

    useEffect(() => {
        localStorage.setItem("modalOpen", open);
    }, [open]);

    return <Modal open={open} onClose={() => setOpen(false)} />;
};
```

#### In the Server

Data that is stored in the server and accessible via an API. This method would require the client to make a request to the server each time the state of the modal changes.

```ts
const App = () => {
    const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
    const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

    useEffect(() => {
        fetch("/api/modal", {
            method: "POST",
            body: JSON.stringify({ open: isOpen }),
        });
    }, [isOpen]);

    return <Modal open={open} onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)} />;
};
```

#### In the URL

This is the encoded data stored in the URL in the form of a `string`. Good examples are Query Parameters (`"/users?userId=desc"`) and Path Parameters (`"/users/1324"`).

## Why choose the URL

As with everything, there are pros and cons to each approach.

#### Pros

-   Shareable between users
-   Fast
-   Global

#### Cons

-   Hard to debug
-   Hard to maintain
-   Hard to scale
