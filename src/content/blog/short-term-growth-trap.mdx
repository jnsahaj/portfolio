Growth isn't linear, or predictable. Let me start by defining it in the context of software engineering.

## What _is_ growth?

<p>Like everything in engineering, _it depends_.</p>
<p>
    Since I'm free to choose my own definition for this article, I'll define it as the act of closing the gap between
    **where you are** and **where you'd rather be**. Both of these points are dynamic and can change with time as you
    acquire new knowledge.

## The trap

You might be familiar with [Greedy Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm). It's a general approach to solving programming problems that involves making the locally optimal choice at each stage. For some problems though, it turns out that making locally optimal choices repeatedly isn't the most optimal path to the answer, because it's not taking into account the bigger picture, data that you don't/can't have at the current stage.

How is it related? because Greedy Algorithms don't work in real-life either. That's the short-term growth trap. When you do something for the small, but measurable reward that it would reap, you are making the locally optimal choice.

## How to escape it?

When you try to seek a roadmap, a walkthrough that tells you what to do at each step of the way, you're onboard the greedy train. It's time to step out fo

It's hard to explain (and believe) but some of the most enlightening and fulfilling moments in my brief career have come from things that I had seemingly randomly learned, or projects I had built, with no expectation of reward at the time. Just pure enthusiasm and curiosity.
