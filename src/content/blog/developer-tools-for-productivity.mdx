My pursuit of a perfectly optimized workflow has led me to these indispensable tools. Here's what works best for me:

## Neovim

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is my primary code editor, offering speed, simplicity, and infinite customization. It does have a steep learning curve, but you can gradually start with Vim motions in your own editor which provide most of the value of neovim anyway. <br />
If you are just starting out, then I would highly recommend using [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)

**What I love ❣️**

-   using `hjkl` to move around instead of arrow keys
-   motions like: `di{` (delete content inside \{_..._\}) , `V5jy` (copy 5 lines down)
-   rich plugins ecosystem: example telescope.nvim for fuzzy search across my project
-   macros
-   brings you closer to the terminal, which has far reaching benefits

## Tmux

[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) enables me to manage multiple terminal sessions effortlessly. I can split terminals into panes, allowing simultaneous task execution—be it running servers, editing files, or monitoring logs. Its session persistence ensures I can pick up exactly where I left off, streamlining task management across projects.

**What I love ❣️**

-   starting a session on any of the listed directories using fuzzy search - enabled by fzf

## Lazygit

[Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) offers a rich TUI for Git workflows. It pairs super well with neovim and tmux, offering keyboard shortcuts for almost all your git needs. I have it setup in neovim such that `<leader>gg` pops up a tmux window with lazygit running.

**What I love ❣️**

-   opening a PR using `"o"`
-   inspecting diff from the file tree, and partial staging

## Window Manager

A tiling window manager is vital for maintaining an organized workspace, and switching between applications without losing focus. **Hot take - a single monitor setup with proper window management is more efficient than a multi-monitor setup**.<br />
The reason for that is you can only focus (think: mouse-focus) on one window at a time. The only exception is when the second screen is purely visual

I use [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) as I'm on macOS. [i3](https://i3wm.org/) is fantastic for Linux

**What I love ❣️**

-   using `alt-1`, `alt-2` etc. to switch between windows
-   fixing the application on a single window number. So my browser will always be open on `alt-1`, my editor on `alt-2` etc. removing any potential overhead when navigating

## Arc Browser

The people working at [Arc](https://arc.net/) have nailed the polished browser experience. It never gets in your way, while providing a seamless browsing experience.

**What I love ❣️**

-   the horizontal tabs - I was skeptical at first but now I can't go back
-   ability to customise keybindings
-   workspace switching without opening a new window on your system
-   saving split-tab groups
